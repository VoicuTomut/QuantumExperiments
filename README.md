I think the most effective way to learn is to apply. In this repository I put some small projects that I used to explore and understand Quantum algorithm.

<ul>
<li>Sound-	A strange way to analyzed sound using a quantum computer taking advantage of QFT. (https://medium.com/@tomutvoicuandrei/a-strange-way-to-analyze-sound-using-a-quantum-computer-9e61c211f445 )</li>
<li> MaxCut-Almost entirely quantum algorithm for Max-Cut problem. It's a good example for dual quantum computing ,quantum gradient descendent.</li>
<li>	QuantumHarmonicOscillator-Just a simple quantum harmonic oscillator simulate with qbits.</li>
</ul>
